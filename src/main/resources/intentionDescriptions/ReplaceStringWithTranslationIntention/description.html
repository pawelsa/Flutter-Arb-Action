<p>
    Detects hardcoded string literals in Dart code and offers to move them to an ARB file for localization, replacing
    them with a reference to the generated translation.
</p>
<p>
    This intention helps you identify and refactor hardcoded user-facing strings, making your Flutter app ready for
    internationalization by extracting them into ARB files and updating the code to use the appropriate translation
    reference.
</p>
<p>Example before applying the intention:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">
Text('Hello world!')
</code></pre>
<p>Example after applying the intention:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">
Text(context.l10n.helloWorld)
</code></pre>
