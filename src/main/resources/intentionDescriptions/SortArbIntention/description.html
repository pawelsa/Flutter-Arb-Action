    Sorts properties in ARB files, ensuring that all keys are ordered alphabetically, with metadata keys (starting with
    <code>@</code>) always placed after their corresponding main property.
</p>
<p>
    This intention helps you keep your ARB files clean and organized, making it easier to maintain translations and
    avoid merge conflicts. It automatically reorders the properties so that main keys come first, followed by their
    metadata, improving readability and consistency across your localization files.
</p>
<p>Example before applying the intention:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "zebra": "Zebra",
  "apple": "Apple",
  "@zebra": {
    "description": "Animal"
  },
  "@apple": {
    "description": "Fruit"
  }
}
</code></pre>
